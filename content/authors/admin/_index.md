Welcome to the website of __Carlos N. Lozano-Andrade__. I am currently a PhD student in the [Center for Microbial Secondary metabolites (CEMIST)](https://cemist.dtu.dk/), [Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine](https://www.bioengineering.dtu.dk/english), at the  [Technical University of Denmark](dtu.dk), under the supervision of  [__Prof. Ákos T. Kovács__](https://www.bioengineering.dtu.dk/english/ResearchNy/Research-Sections/Section-for-Microbial-and-Chemical-Ecology/Bacterial-Interactions-and-Evolution). In my PhD thesis, I'm using microbial ecology principles, molecular biology, and chemical-ecology methods for exploring the role of secondary metabolites produced by _B. subtilis_ on community assembly and the impact on _B. subtilis_ fitness at community level.
